# Eulogizing a champ!

When this small project started. [Joseph Ndung'u](https://github.com/joseph-n) was the one of the first people to test it and play with GeekPlayer. In fact, he was the main motivation. This was simply a quick overnight hack for me and was then known as [YT-VLC](https://bitbucket.org/mugendi/yt-vlc/src). 

He loved it and encouraged me to build it as a CLI only player. He was my brainstorm partner and beta tester number one.

On Sunday, 2nd May, 2021, Joseph passed on. This is his Eulogy.

>Joseph, 
>
>I've known you since your campus days when we yourself, [Areba](https://github.com/theareba) and I won the first ever civic Hackathon in Nyeri with our innovation, [QuickHealth](https://africancoder.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/nyeri-civic-hack-2014/).
>
>Over the years I've known you in many ways, and I  will forever remember you.
>
>I know you loved the song "I'll Wait" by Kygo and Sasha Sloan. I know you loved your music. I know you loved your code. I know so because you often shared clips of you bumping to Kygo as you helped me test Geekplay. I know because it was you who challenged me to build a CLI player because you wanted to listen to your favourite music as you code. 
>
>I know you loved your job and every project you took was a passionate undertaking and your genius shone through. I know this because you helped me debug and perfect GeekPlay even though it was never a project that would make any of us a dime.
>
>I know you worked till late night because the geek in you, the perfectionist in you wouldn't let you sleep till the divs aligned perfectly on whatever html page you were working on. I saw this first hand as we shared about some of your recent pet projects such as https://plagdetector.com and more recently http://eazzybnb.com which you never got to finish ðŸ˜­
>
>I know you loved life. I know you were a true friend, a great mind and gifted Rubyist. I know that you will be missed for all your goodness and beautiful memories. I know that the world lost a great talent and your contributions to the tech world will never be fully realized. You thought big,  a dreamer who left too soon. 
>
>*Fare thee well! ~ **Anthony***

>Jose was one of the first friends I made when I arrived in Kenya in 2018.
>
>From the first time we met (a Sauti sol concert), he was immediately super friendly!
>
>You could say that music and going out was the catalyst for our friendship :D
>
>He also made me discover Nairobi, his favorite places and even organized my first trip outside the capital with other friends.
>
>Jose was incredible, his joie de vivre, his smile, his love of adventure, his open-mindedness, his welcoming and kind side, his passion for coding and photography, and his famous Gwara Gwara! I used to make fun of him for that (he would do it on every and any songs lol), but also for his pronounced taste for house music that I hated. 
>
>Now I'll only think of him when I listen to Kygo and others.
> 
>Jose was amazing and he'll be missed. 
>
>Repose en paix Jose et que les coeurs de tous tes proches soient apaisÃ©s.
>
>~ **Joyce aka LEGGIT girl ;)**

> Joseph,
>
> *`Jose`* that's what most of us used to call you, you inspired me to program, to work hard and most of all to stay focused. 
>
>I remember when you created *`bubblews scrapper`* and most of us subscribed to this service so that we could earn an extra coin in campus.
>
> I miss the days when we used to hangout together at Ihub, NaiLab and YMCA.
>
> *Until we meet again, Rest in peace buddy. ~ **Hamfri***

> Joseph's story is one of growth, balance and exploration.
> 
> As we bid farewell to Jose, our hearts are heavy with the loss of an exemplary software engineer, talented designer whose craftsmanship and professionalism was always visible in all of his work.
> 
> He liked to explore technology and was always seeking out the next big thing. He never turned down an opportunity.
> 
> Lucky enough to witness his journey of novice to expert, Jose did not rush to make money like many of us did, he honed his craft slowly but surely, learned every day of his life, was never shy to show ignorance if he needed to ask something he didn't know, and when he was ready for the professional world, he worked with diligence, commitment and servitude in all his projects.
> 
> His designs were always beautiful, he loved it when things looked good.
> 
> Joseph the man, as I experienced him, was a devout planner, never arbitrary in anything he did, lived an organized life, striking great balance between his professional and social life. He spent his money wisely, saved and invested in ideas and businesses, and every so often, rewarded himself by pursuing his personal hobbies like traveling, love for gadgets, good food and the company of friends.
> 
> He loved his church, the Catholic church, was strong willed, firm and principled. He was a good man.
> 
> A huge gap you have left amongst your family and friends, we will love and cherish you equally even in death, and the moments we spent together will remain with us for the rest of our lives.
> 
> We are thankful to God for the life and times he gave you to be with us, our lives you touched and enriched in so many ways. The times we laughed, the times we worked together, the times we had fun together, it is these memories that will keep us strong, and may we find comfort in knowing that you lived you best life, and worked so hard to pursue perfection alongside your greatest dreams.
> 
> You brought many of your friends together because you were social, kind, good willed,  dependable.Jose was a good friend and thank you for the support you have showed him.
> 
>  *Fare the well Jose, till we meet again! ~**Tom Mugo***
