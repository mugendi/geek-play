# Eulogizing a champ!

When this small project started. [Joseph Ndung'u](https://github.com/joseph-n) was the one of the first people to test it and play with GeekPlayer. In fact, he was the main motivation. This was simply a quick overnight hack for me and was then known as [YT-VLC](https://bitbucket.org/mugendi/yt-vlc/src). 

He loved it and encouraged me to build it as a CLI only player. He was my brainstorm partner and beta tester number one.

On Sunday, 2nd May, 2021, Joseph passed on. This is his Eulogy.

>Joseph,

>I've known you since your campus days when we yourself, [Areba](https://github.com/theareba) and I won the first ever civic Hackathon in Nyeri with our innovation, [QuickHealth](https://africancoder.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/nyeri-civic-hack-2014/).

>Over the years I've known you in many ways, and I  will forever remember you.
>
>I know you loved the song "I'll Wait" by Kygo and Sasha Sloan. I know you loved your music. I know you loved your code. I know so because you often shared clips of you bumping to Kygo as you helped me test Geekplay. I know because it was you who challenged me to build a CLI player because you wanted to listen to your favourite music as you code. 
>
>I know you loved your job and every project you took was a passionate undertaking and your genius shone through. I know this because you helped me debug and perfect GeekPlay even though it was never a project that would make any of us a dime.
>
>I know you worked till late night because the geek in you, the perfectionist in you wouldn't let you sleep till the divs aligned perfectly on whatever html page you were working on. I saw this first hand as we shared about some of your recent pet projects such as https://plagdetector.com and more recently http://eazzybnb.com which you never got to finish ğŸ˜­
>
>I know you loved life. I know you were a true friend, a great mind and gifted Rubyist. I know that you will be missed for all your goodness and beautiful memories. I know that the world lost a great talent and your contributions to the tech world will never be fully realized. You thought big,  a dreamer who left too soon.
